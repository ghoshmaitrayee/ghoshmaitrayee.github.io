title: "Exotic Planetary Chemistry"
excerpt: "My research centers on the first-principles investigation of materials under extreme pressure-temperature (P–T) conditions relevant to the deep interiors of terrestrial planets, combining Kohn-Sham DFT-based molecular dynamics, machine-learned interatomic potentials, and thermodynamic integration techniques to probe melting, transport, and phase behavior.
In recent work, I demonstrated that bcc iron, under Earth's inner core pressures (~300–4000 GPa) and subsolidus temperatures, exhibits anisotropic diffusion along the ⟨111⟩ directions, enabled by a low-energy barrier and accompanied by dynamic/mechanical stability. This finding offers a potential atomistic basis for seismological observations of anisotropic P-wave propagation and enhanced electrical/thermal conductivities in Earth's inner core, and also implies altered convective mechanisms due to reduced viscosity.
I also investigated the high-P–T behavior of alumina (Al₂O₃)—a geophysically and experimentally important oxide—using extensive first-principles MD. The solid–liquid transition induces an insulator-to-semimetal transition, significantly enhancing both σ<sub>dc</sub> and κ. Surprisingly, the Rh₂O₃(II) → CaIrO₃ transition shows negligible change in transport, while CaIrO₃ → U₂S₃ is associated with increased conductivities. The results highlight the role of phase transitions and defects (e.g., oxygen vacancies) in shaping planetary magnetic properties.
Complementing these studies, I explored the carbon-hydrogen phase behavior under conditions (~150–500 GPa, 5000–9000 K) where diamond formation from polystyrene has been observed in dynamic compression experiments. My QMD simulations reveal that phase-separated carbon-hydrogen systems are thermodynamically favored, with hydrogen destabilizing the diamond lattice via C–H bonding and lowering the diamond melting curve—providing insight into carbon segregation and diamond formation in icy planets and meteoritic environments.
Finally, I developed a machine-learned force field (MLFF) framework within VASP to model nickel melting and transport up to 40 GPa—conditions relevant to Mars and Venus. The MLFF captures DFT accuracy with substantially reduced computational cost, enabling melting curve construction and elastic property analysis over long time scales and system sizes (>10,000 atoms). I also propose extensions to Ni–Fe alloys, with implications for core dynamics in differentiated rocky bodies.
Together, these studies establish a rigorous quantum–statistical foundation for modeling complex materials in deep planetary environments, and enable cross-scale integration with geodynamic and planetary evolution models. <br/><img src='/images/Profile-Pic.jpeg'>"

🧪 Research Overview

My research focuses on understanding the behavior of materials under extreme pressure and temperature conditions relevant to the interiors of Earth and rocky exoplanets. By combining first-principles quantum molecular dynamics (DFT-MD) with machine learning force fields (MLFFs), I study how metals, oxides, and hydrocarbons melt, diffuse, and conduct energy at high pressures—revealing insights into planetary structure, dynamics, and evolution.

🧭 Iron and Inner Core Dynamics
I investigate body-centered cubic (bcc) iron at pressures of 300–4000 GPa, where I find anisotropic diffusion along the ⟨111⟩ direction—a possible explanation for the seismic anisotropy of Earth’s inner core. These results also suggest enhanced conductivity and reduced viscosity, with direct implications for core convection and magnetic field generation.

🌋 Alumina at Ultrahigh Pressures
I explore alumina (Al₂O₃) in the 130–1300 GPa and 4000–20,000 K regime, where it transitions from an insulator to a semimetal upon melting. This phase change significantly increases both electrical and thermal conductivity, providing a new mechanism for dynamo action in silicate-rich exoplanets. I also study solid–solid transitions (e.g., Rh₂O₃(II) → CaIrO₃ → U₂S₃), showing contrasting effects on transport properties.

💎 Carbon–Hydrogen Systems and Diamond Formation
My simulations on polystyrene under shock conditions confirm that carbon and hydrogen phase-separate, forming stable diamond-hydrogen interfaces. Hydrogen atoms destabilize the diamond lattice when inserted, and depress the melting curve due to C–H bonding—helping explain experimental results on diamond formation in planetary ices and astrophysical environments.

🪐 Nickel in Planetary Cores
Using an on-the-fly trained MLFF, I modeled nickel melting up to 40 GPa—conditions relevant to Mars and Venus. The MLFF reproduces DFT-level accuracy while enabling large-scale, long-timescale simulations, allowing me to construct melting curves and evaluate elastic and transport properties for Ni and Fe-doped Ni alloys. This supports improved modeling of core thermodynamics and differentiation in smaller rocky planets.
