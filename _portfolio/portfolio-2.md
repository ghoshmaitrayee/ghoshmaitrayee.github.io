title: "Equation of state for fusion materials"
excerpt: "I developed a first-principles equation-of-state (EOS) table for a CHON (C-H-O-N) resin—an advanced material proposed for use in inertial confinement fusion (ICF) experiments.
Using quantum simulations, I showed that CHON materials compress more efficiently than traditional polystyrene (CH), thanks to their oxygen and nitrogen content.
Simulations of fusion capsules reveal that CHON outperforms CH as a laser ablator, offering a potential path to more efficient energy delivery in fusion research. <br/><img src='/images/500x300.png'>"

In the pursuit of clean energy, inertial confinement fusion (ICF) aims to recreate the conditions inside stars—by using 
powerful lasers to compress small capsules of fuel. The outer shell, or ablator, 
plays a critical role in driving this compression. My research investigates how novel materials can improve this process.
Using a combination of first-principles simulations—including Kohn-Sham and orbital-free density functional theory 
(DFT) molecular dynamics—I constructed a wide-range equation-of-state (EOS) table for a quaternary compound 
with the formula CH₁.₇₂O₀.₃₇N₀.₀₈₆. This compound, known as a CHON resin, incorporates carbon, hydrogen, 
oxygen, and nitrogen in proportions relevant to cutting-edge ablator materials.
The results show that CHON resins achieve higher compression ratios than traditional CH (polystyrene), 
particularly under laser shock conditions. This is due to the additional degrees of freedom 
and energy-carrying capacity introduced by oxygen and nitrogen atoms. Thermodynamic and transport properties, 
including bulk sound velocity and shock Hugoniot curves, were calculated and benchmarked against 
theoretical models like the ideal gas and Fermi-degenerate electron gas.
Finally, I used these EOS data in radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of fusion targets. 
The outcome: CHON consistently outperforms CH as an ablator in laser-direct-drive fusion designs, 
potentially enhancing energy delivery and compression efficiency in future fusion experiments.
