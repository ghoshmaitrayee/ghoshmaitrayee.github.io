title: "Cooperative diffusion in body‑centered cubic iron in Earth and super‑Earths’ inner core conditions"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: /publication/bcc‑Fe‑diffusion
excerpt: |
  - Based on first‑principles simulations, cooperative diffusion was observed along the fast ⟨111⟩ directions of **bcc iron** at **pressures ≈300–4000 GPa** and **temperatures 2000–4000 K below melting** :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.
  - The low energy barriers along ⟨111⟩ enable diffusion even while iron remains **mechanically and dynamically stable**, with **strong elastic anisotropy** :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.
  - These findings offer a plausible explanation for seismologically observed **positive correlation between P‑wave velocity and attenuation** in Earth's inner core :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.
  - Enhanced diffusivity could **raise electrical conductivity** and **reduce viscosity**, thereby altering **core convection dynamics** and influencing the geodynamo in Earth and super‑Earths :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}.
  - Results demand incorporation in future **geophysical and planetary models** of inner‑core structure and evolution :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}.

## 🔑 Key Points from the Paper

- **Study Focus**: Investigates atomic diffusion in **body-centered cubic (bcc) iron** under extreme **inner core conditions** — pressures of ~330–4000 GPa and temperatures ~2000–4000 K below melting.

- **Main Finding**: Bcc iron exhibits **cooperative atomic diffusion** along the ⟨111⟩ crystallographic directions, even while remaining mechanically and dynamically stable.

- **Mechanism**: Diffusion occurs via **string-like collective motion** of atoms, enabled by **low energy barriers** and thermal excitation.

- **Significance**:
  - Explains the **coexistence of high seismic velocity and high attenuation** observed in Earth’s inner core.
  - Suggests **elevated electrical and thermal conductivity** in bcc iron at core conditions.
  - Implies **low viscosity**, which could impact **inner-core dynamics**, **solid-state convection**, and **magnetic field generation**.

- **Planetary Implications**:
  - Bcc iron may be the dominant phase in **super-Earth cores**, where even higher pressures prevail.
  - These findings should be incorporated into **geodynamo models** and simulations of **planetary evolution**.

- **Methods Used**: Large-scale **first-principles molecular dynamics simulations** based on **density functional theory (DFT)**, analyzing both atomic trajectories and elastic properties, supported with **machine-learning simulations**.
