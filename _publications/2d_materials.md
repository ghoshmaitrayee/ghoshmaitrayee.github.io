collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: /publication/pjt‑silicene
excerpt: |
  - Investigates **pseudo‑Jahn–Teller (PJT) effects** in **silicene, germanene, and stanene** using **crystal orbital vibronic coupling density analysis**.
  - Shows that PJT interactions can lead to **symmetry breaking and distortions** in these graphene‑analogue 2D materials.
  - Quantifies vibronic coupling strength and analyzes the **structural and electronic implications** of PJT distortions.
  - Highlights how lower crystalline symmetry in silicene, germanene, and stanene arises from cooperative electronic–vibrational coupling.
  - Provides insights relevant to **2D materials design**, especially for electronic and optoelectronic applications where PJT plays a role.
