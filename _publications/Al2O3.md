title: "Melting and transport properties of Al₂O₃ at extreme conditions"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: /publication/Al2O3
excerpt: |
  - Extensive first-principles molecular dynamics simulations were performed at ~130–1300 GPa and 4000–20 000 K.
  - Melting of Al₂O₃ results in an insulator-to-semimetal transition, significantly enhancing:
    - Electrical conductivity (σ_dc)
    - Thermal conductivity (κ)
  - The solid–solid transition from Rh₂O₃(II) to CaIrO₃ at ~160 GPa causes negligible changes in transport properties.
  - The CaIrO₃ to U₂S₃ transition at ~450 GPa leads to marked increases in σ_dc and κ.
  - Oxygen vacancies enhance conductivity and thermal transport.
  - Forming solid solutions with MgSiO₃ has minimal effect, especially in the solid phase.
