title: "Melting and transport properties of Al₂O₃ at extreme conditions"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: /publication/Al2O3
excerpt: |
  - Extensive first-principles molecular dynamics simulations were performed at ~130–1300 GPa and 4000–20 000 K.
  - Melting of Al₂O₃ results in an insulator-to-semimetal transition, significantly enhancing:
    - Electrical conductivity (σ_dc)
    - Thermal conductivity (κ)
  - The solid–solid transition from Rh₂O₃(II) to CaIrO₃ at ~160 GPa causes negligible changes in transport properties.
  - The CaIrO₃ to U₂S₃ transition at ~450 GPa leads to marked increases in σ_dc and κ.
  - Oxygen vacancies enhance conductivity and thermal transport.
  - Forming solid solutions with MgSiO₃ has minimal effect, especially in the solid phase.

  - This study investigates the behavior of alumina (Al₂O₃) under extreme pressures (130–1300 GPa) and temperatures (4000–20,000 K), conditions relevant to deep planetary interiors and high-energy-density experiments.
  - Using first-principles molecular dynamics, the work reveals:
    - Melting induces an insulator-to-semimetal transition, leading to significant increases in electrical (σ_dc) and thermal (κ) conductivity.
    - This transition may enable **magnetic field generation** in the deep mantles of Earth, super-Earths, and other rocky exoplanets, where alumina or alumina-rich materials are stable.
  - The solid–solid phase transition from **Rh₂O₃(II)** to **CaIrO₃-type** at ~160 GPa shows minimal impact on transport properties, contrary to earlier expectations.
  - A second phase transition from **CaIrO₃-type to U₂S₃-type** at ~450 GPa causes sharp increases in σ_dc and κ, potentially altering the convective and magnetic behavior of planetary interiors at extreme depths.
  - The presence of **oxygen vacancies** significantly boosts conductivity and thermal transport, suggesting that defect chemistry plays a role in energy transport deep inside planets.
  - Forming solid solutions with **MgSiO₃** (a major mantle silicate) does not significantly affect transport properties in the solid state, implying Al₂O₃ retains its conductive behavior even in mixed compositions.
  - These findings provide a critical framework for modeling heat and charge transport in terrestrial and super-Earth mantles and have implications for interpreting high-pressure experiments involving Al₂O₃.
