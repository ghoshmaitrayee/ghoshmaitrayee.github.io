permalink: /publication/Al2O3
excerpt: 'Alumina (Al₂O₃), a key material in planetary mantles and high-pressure experiments, has been studied under extreme conditions (130–1300 GPa, 4000–20,000 K) using first-principles molecular dynamics. The study reveals that:
1. Melting of Al₂O₃ leads to an insulator-to-semimetal transition, significantly enhancing electrical (σ_dc) and thermal (κ) conductivity—important for magnetic field generation in planetary interiors.
2. The Rh₂O₃(II) to CaIrO₃ solid-solid transition at 160 GPa shows negligible change in transport properties, challenging prior assumptions.
3. A further CaIrO₃ to U₂S₃ transition at 450 GPa results in notable increases in σ_dc and κ.
4.Oxygen vacancies can enhance transport properties, while solution with MgSiO₃ has little effect, especially in solid phases.
These insights improve our understanding of Al₂O₃'s role in deep planetary interiors and experimental applications.'
