excerpt: >
  Based on extensive first‑principles molecular‑dynamics simulations at pressures of ~130–1300 GPa and temperatures of 4000–20 000 K, this study reveals that melting of Al₂O₃ induces an insulator‑to‑semimetal transition with significant enhancement of electrical (σ_dc) and thermal (κ) conductivity. The Rh₂O₃(II) → CaIrO₃ solid–solid transition at ~160 GPa has negligible transport‑property change, while the subsequent CaIrO₃ → U₂S₃ transition at ~450 GPa leads to marked increases in conductivity. Oxygen vacancies enhance transport, but MgSiO₃ solid solutions have minimal impact.
