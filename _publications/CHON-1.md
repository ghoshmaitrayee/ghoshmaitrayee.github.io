collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: /publication/CHON‑EOS
excerpt: |
  - Developed a comprehensive **equation-of-state (EOS) table** for a CH₁.₇₂O₀.₃₇N₀.₀₈₆ quaternary organic resin, spanning densities from 0 to 1044 g/cm³ and temperatures up to 10⁹ K.
  - Combined **Kohn–Sham DFT molecular dynamics**, **orbital-free DFT-MD**, and **numerical extrapolation** to generate accurate thermodynamic and Hugoniot data.
  - Benchmarking against ideal-gas and Fermi-degenerate electron gas models shows the CHON resin has a **higher maximum compression ratio** than polystyrene (CH), due to oxygen and nitrogen content.
  - Derived predictions for **shock Hugoniot, thermodynamic properties, and bulk sound velocity**, closely compared to C–H materials.
  - Embedded the EOS table into radiation-hydrodynamics simulations of inertial confinement fusion (ICF) targets:
    - Showed that CHON resin **outperforms CH ablators** in laser direct-drive designs, offering **better stability** and **higher energy yield potential**.
