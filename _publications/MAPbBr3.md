title: "Light‑enhanced oxygen degradation of MAPbBr₃ single crystal"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: /publication/MAPbBr3‑degradation
excerpt: |
  - Examines the accelerated degradation of **methylammonium lead bromide (MAPbBr₃)** perovskite single crystals under **simultaneous oxygen exposure and light illumination** in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV).
  - Utilizes **X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)** with controlled oxygen dose (~10¹⁰ Langmuir) and light exposure to monitor chemical changes on the crystal surface.
  - Observes a **~17× enhancement in C, Br, and N loss** compared to oxygen-only and light-only exposures, indicating a synergistic degradation mechanism.
  - Photoluminescence (PL) emission is **strongly quenched** under combined exposure—contrasting with PL enhancement seen in oxygen-only conditions.
  - Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and focused ion beam (FIB) imaging show **surface roughening and morphology degradation** induced by combined exposure.
  - **Density Functional Theory (DFT)** calculations suggest formation of **superoxide species** and an oxygen-induced gap state as likely drivers of degradation under light.
  - Highlights critical implications for **stability and lifetime** of perovskite optoelectronic devices under ambient conditions.
  - *Author contribution: Ghosh worked on the DFT calculations.*
