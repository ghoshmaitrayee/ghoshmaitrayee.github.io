title: "Cooperative diffusion in body‑centered cubic iron in Earth and super‑Earths’ inner core conditions"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: /publication/bcc‑Fe‑diffusion
excerpt: |
  - Based on first‑principles simulations, cooperative diffusion was observed along the fast ⟨111⟩ directions of **bcc iron** at **pressures ≈300–4000 GPa** and **temperatures 2000–4000 K below melting** :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.
  - The low energy barriers along ⟨111⟩ enable diffusion even while iron remains **mechanically and dynamically stable**, with **strong elastic anisotropy** :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.
  - These findings offer a plausible explanation for seismologically observed **positive correlation between P‑wave velocity and attenuation** in Earth's inner core :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.
  - Enhanced diffusivity could **raise electrical conductivity** and **reduce viscosity**, thereby altering **core convection dynamics** and influencing the geodynamo in Earth and super‑Earths :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}.
  - Results demand incorporation in future **geophysical and planetary models** of inner‑core structure and evolution :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}.
